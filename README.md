Once upon a time, there was a little non-profit called Umuzi. Umuzi was an in-person training provider, focused on creating opportunities for high-potential, under-served youth. We trained hundreds of people in our cosy studios in Jeppestown.

And then 2020 happened. It was rough for all of us in different ways and it nearly sank Umuzi.

In this talk, I'll tell you about how we managed to survive. We ensured the well-being of our learners even in their homes, devised ways to offer remote support despite financial constraints, and achieved a remarkable scaling-up feat.

Our tailored learner management software is a pivotal aspect of our narrative. Faced with stringent resource limitations, we had to rapidly construct the right solution. We will delve into our decision-making process, the chosen tech stack, and the final outcome.
